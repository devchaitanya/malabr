# Launch Chromium with MALABR tunables, and record exactly which config
# produced the run.
#
# Why this exists: every tunable here is a base::FeatureParam rather than a
# C++ constant, specifically so it can be changed WITHOUT a rebuild (a full
# Chromium build on this machine costs 8-9 hours). This script is the place
# those values live, so an experiment is reproducible from one file instead
# of a remembered command line.
#
# phase1_design.md 11a requires calibration numbers be tied to the config
# that produced them -- that is what the run-log at the bottom is for.
#
# Usage:
#   ./run_malabr.sh                                  # defaults below
#   FRAME_READ_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=120 ./run_malabr.sh   # override one value
#   ./run_malabr.sh --dry-run                        # print, do not launch
#   ./run_malabr.sh -- --incognito                   # pass extra chrome args

#     (default) = flat out. Try 0.5 if inference makes the machine feel slow.
#   MALABR_CPU_MAX   "N" cores, "N%", or "0"/"off"  -- HARD: the server moves
#     its own pid into a transient systemd scope with a kernel-enforced cpu.max
#     quota a spike or a bug cannot cross. UNSET = a computed default (half the
#     logical CPUs, never below n_threads+1) -- a backstop that never bites
#     normal operation. Needs a user systemd + busctl; best-effort, falls back
