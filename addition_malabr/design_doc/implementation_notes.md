# MALABR Phase 1 — implementation notes

Working notes kept alongside `phase1_design.md` while the Python side was
built. Records (a) how far the build order has got, (b) facts established by
measurement that should not be re-asserted without re-measuring, and (c) points
where the design document turned out to be wrong or underspecified and an
implementation decision had to be taken.

## Environment

- Python 3.10 conda environment; `llama-cpp-python` 0.3.34.
- Test models: `addition_malabr/models/Qwen3-0.6B-Q8_0.gguf`,
  `gemma-3-1b-it-Q4_K_M.gguf`.
- `malabr_service/__init__.py` now imports nothing at package import time.
  It previously did `from .runtime import run_server`, dragging every importer
  through `ML.Request` -> `flatbuffers` (not installed), which made `engine.py`
  impossible to import standalone.
- Development machine is memory-constrained; use a small `n_ctx` in tests.

## Build order — status

1. [DONE] SlotAllocator + wipe-on-acquire        engine.py
2. [DONE] chat template application (§6c) — ChatFormatter, model-agnostic
3. [DONE] single-threaded engine loop, EOS / output cap (+ §6d streamer, §8 cap)
4. [DONE] compaction (§8) + position-shift fix + input-cap gate 2
5. [DONE] scheduler §9a/§9b (round budget, aging, chunked prefill, closed loop)
then:
6. [DONE] protocol.py — 6-field header, frames, payload bound, control msgs
7. [DONE] runtime.py — control route, reader thread, PID lock
8. [DONE] config.py — startup-computed n_ctx/n_threads, calibration path
9. [DONE] calibration.py — §11a phases A–G + Phase B-prefill
10.[DONE] deleted supervisor.py/training.py/storage.py; wrote real app.py
11.[DONE] §12 harness — 45 executed, 20 declared browser-only skips

## Verified facts from measurement

- KV leak is REAL: slot reused without wipe still reports pos_max=12 for a
  13-token conversation. Wipe-on-acquire clears to -1.
- `llama_memory_seq_rm(mem,slot,-1,-1)` returned True in every case tried
  (full, partial, empty slot) on Qwen3. Could NOT force a False. The return
  check in _wipe_and_verify is DEFENSIVE, not observed-necessary.
- Wiping one seq does not disturb another (slot 3 wiped, slot 4 kept pos_max=19).
- The SlotAllocator lock: an unlocked pop() does NOT hand out duplicate slots
  (list.pop() is atomic under the GIL — 0 duplicates measured). The real race is
  CHECK-THEN-ACT: 120 IndexErrors / 160 acquires with a 2ms widened window and no
  lock; 0 with the lock. Symptom is a crash on a request that should have been a
  clean "no capacity" reject.
- Concurrency and scheduler tests must be run against a deliberately broken
  implementation to confirm they can fail at all. A first attempt at the slot
  race test PASSED against a lock-free allocator, i.e. it had no detection
  power. This applies directly to §12 tests 52/55/62/63.

## Design-document corrections and open decisions

1. **§6c's incremental fragment is WRONG as written; replaced with a derived
   delta.** The doc says subsequent turns append a hardcoded
   `<|im_start|>{role}\n{content}<|im_end|>\n`. That is ChatML, i.e.
   Qwen-specific, and it is also wrong for the assistant turn (turn 1 with
   add_ass=True already leaves that block OPEN, so a fragment would duplicate
   the header). ChatFormatter instead renders the full conversation with the
   model's own template and takes the suffix past what is already in KV.
   Verified on gemma-3, whose delta begins `<end_of_turn>` — the hardcoded
   ChatML version would have silently malformed every turn after the first.
   **Recommend correcting §6c itself.**
2. **SlotAllocator must NOT touch the model from a connection thread — §7 is
   self-contradictory here.** §7's sketch has `acquire()` call
   `llama_memory_seq_rm`, while §7's own concurrency note says connection
   threads create sessions concurrently, and §7 separately names
   single-threadedness a load-bearing invariant. Those cannot all hold.
   `llama.h` states "The API is thread-safe" EXACTLY ONCE, scoped to the
   Tokenization section (line 1131); the Memory section (line 711) has no such
   guarantee. Wiping KV from a connection thread while the engine thread is
   inside `llama_decode()` is an undocumented data race whose symptom is
   corrupted KV — silently wrong output, not a crash.
   FIX APPLIED: acquire()/release() are now pure bookkeeping (any thread);
   `prepare(slot)` does the wipe and is ENGINE THREAD ONLY; `assert_ready(slot)`
   guards the decode path so a missed wipe is a loud error instead of a leak.
   The release-side "belt and braces" wipe was DROPPED — it would have to run on
   a connection thread, and wipe-on-acquire exists precisely because release
   cannot be trusted. **Recommend correcting §7.**
3. **§6b's rollback target for GENERATING is not usable; rolling the WHOLE
   turn back instead.** §6b says a GENERATING session rolls back to
   `pos_before_generation`, keeping the user message and the generation prompt
   in KV. That is not a valid boundary: the KV at that point ends inside an
   OPEN assistant block (the template's trailing generation prompt), so
   appending a new user turn after it produces malformed structure — caught by
   ChatFormatter's prefix check, not by reasoning. Rolling back to
   `pos_before_request` is also what §6b's OWN stated rule requires ("a turn
   only enters permanent context if it reaches EOS or the output cap"). A turn
   is the user message AND its response, so both go. `pos_before_generation` is
   still tracked — §8 compaction must shift it, and resume/regenerate would
   need it. **Recommend correcting §6b.**
4. **§6b and §6c were never reconciled: rollback must undo the FORMATTER too.**
   §6b specifies rollback purely as KV positions; §6c later added a second
   per-session state (the rendered conversation) that must roll back in
   lockstep. Rolling one without the other desyncs the formatter from the KV
   and the next turn is built on a conversation the model never saw. Added
   `ChatFormatter.checkpoint()/restore()`, captured in `_begin_turn` at exactly
   the same moment as `pos_before_request`. **Recommend §6b naming this.**
5. **§8 compaction must drop the FORMATTER's messages too — same gap as §6b.**
   §8 specifies compaction entirely as KV positions and never mentions the
   rendered conversation. Dropping KV without dropping the matching messages
   leaves `_rendered` describing content the model no longer has. Added
   `ChatFormatter.drop_messages()`, called from `compact()`, plus `msg_index`
   on each Turn (shifted like the positions). Verified: formatter render length
   == s.pos after compaction (330 == 330). **Recommend §8 name this.**
6. **Turn boundary = [user-delta start, response end), and that choice is
   load-bearing.** §8 says "aligned to chat-template boundaries" without saying
   which. This one works because every delta BEGINS with the terminator closing
   the preceding assistant block (a consequence of §6c deriving deltas from the
   template) — so dropping a whole exchange leaves the survivor's block closed
   by the next surviving delta, well-formed with no repair step.
7. **§9a's aging pass cannot rescue a session costing more than the whole
   budget — its prose and its code disagree.** §9a says a deep session "simply
   runs alone in its own round, spending the whole budget on itself, which
   harms nobody else". Its code gives that unconditional-first-pick escape ONLY
   to foreground. Measured: a background session at pos 6000 (100ms vs a 50ms
   round) was excluded 60/60 rounds with NO foreground present — permanent
   starvation, not the bounded limit §9a describes. FIX: aged background gets
   the same `or not picks` escape. Streak then bounded at exactly 5.
   **Recommend correcting §9a.**
8. **§9b's prefill chunk-minimum rule starves, taken literally.** §9b says
   "if n < PREFILL_CHUNK_MIN and n < remaining: continue  # wait for a rounder
   budget". If decode picks keep leaving less than a minimum chunk's budget,
   that holds EVERY round and the prompt is never prefilled. Measured: 200
   rounds, zero chunks. §9b bounds decode starvation with aging but leaves
   prefill unbounded. FIX: MAX_PREFILL_STALLS, then force one minimum chunk —
   overruns the bound by at most one chunk, which is finite, unlike never
   answering. **Recommend correcting §9b.**
9. **Where protocol.py actually broke is NOT what the handoff says.** The
   handoff and §10a state it "splits the header into 3 fields and raises
   otherwise". It used `split(",", 2)` — maxsplit=2 — so a 6-field header
   yields exactly THREE parts, the count check PASSES, and it dies later on
   `int()` of the merged remainder with "invalid payload size". Same outcome
   (everything rejected), different mechanism. Minor, but the handoff's
   description is wrong. Also: `mserver_uds.cc`'s comment claims origin may be
   the literal "null" when opaque; `malabr_api.cc:77` rejects opaque origins
   before that point, so the comment is stale.
10. **Stop condition uses `llama_vocab_is_eog`, not `== llama_vocab_eos`.**
   §5b describes the EOS check as verified-correct, but eos() returns ONE token
   while Qwen3 flags SIX as end-of-generation (gemma-3 flags 3). Comparing
   against eos alone would miss the rest and run to the output cap.
   **Recommend correcting §5b.**

### Further corrections found while building runtime.py

11. **The outbox must be per-REQUEST, not per-session.** §7 calls it "the
    session's outbox". Under §6b's single-flight replace TWO handlers are
    briefly alive: the superseded one waiting for its terminal frame and the
    new one waiting for tokens. One shared queue means whichever polls first
    steals the other's frames — the superseded client could receive the new
    response, or hang until its 60s read timeout. Each request now owns a
    queue; the engine writes to whichever is current, and the swap happens on
    the engine thread AFTER the superseded terminal frame is written to the old
    one.

12. **`LIVE_TABS` must exempt `tab_id == -1`.** -1 is the documented
    "not tab-scoped" value and can never appear in a list of live tabs, so a
    naive "reap anything not in the list" reaps those sessions instantly, on
    the very first reconciliation. Not mentioned in §5f.

13. **Single-instance enforcement must check a PID before touching the
    socket.** §10 already flags that the inherited delete-stale-socket pattern
    is dangerous; the ordering is the specific part that matters. The socket is
    only unlinked AFTER the pid lock confirms no live owner, otherwise a second
    process can delete a live instance's socket and steal the path.

14. **§11's memory formula and §7's stated `n_ctx` disagree by 4.6x, and the
    formula is the wrong one.** §11 gives
    `n_ctx = MemAvailable * 0.8 / BYTES_PER_TOKEN`; §7 states `n_ctx = 16384`
    outright. On the development machine the formula yields **75,340 tokens
    (7.7 GB of KV)** against §7's 16,384 (1.7 GB). The formula overshoots for
    three reasons: `MemAvailable` counts reclaimable page cache as free, which
    is true for transient allocations and false for a permanent one-shot
    reservation (here almost all of that 9 GB is cache, and swap is already
    full); it never subtracts the model weights, which are also resident; and
    it leaves nothing for the browser — whose protection is the entire point of
    the design. Corrected to `0.5 * (MemAvailable - browser_reserve -
    model_bytes)`, capped at §7's 16384. That lands on exactly 2048
    tokens/session on reference hardware and degrades sensibly on smaller
    machines (2 GB -> 4096 floor, 4 GB -> 6880). **Recommend correcting §11.**

## First real measurements of the assembled engine

Qwen3-0.6B-Q8_0, n_ctx 4096, n_seq_max 4, n_threads 3 (quota-matched), 4
physical cores. Full calibration takes ~43s; it is cached to disk afterwards.

    Phase A  threads   1 -> 18.3, 2 -> 33.2, 4 -> 46.8 tok/s
                       fastest is 4, quota caps at 3, so 3 is chosen
    Phase B  decode    pos   32 -> 46.1 tok/s (median), 45.1 (worst)
                       pos  256 -> 37.1 / 31.5   <- 15% spread
                       pos  960 -> 29.0 / 27.0
    Phase B-prefill    depth  32 -> 279 tok/s
                       depth 512 -> 195 tok/s
    Phase C  joint     4 sessions @ depth 512, batched:
                       64.4 tok/s aggregate, 16.1 each

Three things worth recording:

- **Prefill is ~6x decode, not the order of magnitude §9b assumed.** 279 vs
  46 tok/s at depth 32. §14 recorded prefill as entirely unmeasured; this is
  the first number. Same direction as predicted, smaller factor.
- **Phase C does not contradict the document's 12.5 tok/s figure, it
  complements it.** At depth 512 batching gives 64.4 aggregate against 31.6
  solo — a 2x benefit. The document's measurement at depth 1500 gave 12.5
  aggregate against 25.1 solo, i.e. batching *hurt*. Both fit "batching stops
  paying once sessions are deep"; this is the shallow end of that curve.
- **The measured trial spread (1–15%) justifies the median/worst split.** At
  pos 256 the spread was 15%, so a round admitted on the median estimate there
  really could overrun its budget.

### Corrections found by running the §12 suite

15. **§9b's forced prefill chunk broke the very bound it sits inside.** My
    anti-starvation fix (force `PREFILL_CHUNK_MIN` through after N stalls) was
    measured to overrun the round budget by **87 ms against 50 ms, in 20% of
    rounds**. That trades "prefill never runs" for "the ~50ms preemption bound
    breaks regularly", which is the wrong way round — the bound is the
    headline claim. Fixed to admit `max(1, affordable)` instead:
    `PREFILL_CHUNK_MIN` is an EFFICIENCY floor ("below this, per-call overhead
    dominates"), not a correctness one. Result: 0 over-budget rounds, prompt
    still progresses.

16. **The formatter rollback checkpoint goes stale across compaction —
    §8's own warning, applied to a reference §8 does not know exists.** §8
    lists the live absolute positions compaction must shift. The formatter
    checkpoint added for correction 4 is another one, and missing it made a
    replace-after-compaction restore to a message count that no longer
    existed. Caught by the formatter's own prefix check (§12 test 53), not by
    review. The checkpoint is now a message COUNT, shifted in `compact()` like
    any position, rather than a `(count, rendered_length)` pair.

17. **An empty conversation must render as the empty string.** The chat
    template emits a bare generation prompt for zero messages
    (`'<|im_start|>assistant\n'` on Qwen3). Returning that after rolling a
    session's FIRST turn back claims KV content the cache does not hold, and
    breaks the prefix check on the next turn.

### §12 coverage

42 tests execute here. 21 are declared SKIP because they need a real browser
(window focus, iframes, `chrome.storage.session`, content-script injection,
`cpu.max` quota timing) — listed explicitly in `tests/test_phase1.py` rather
than silently omitted, so the gap between "Phase 1 done" and "Phase 1 tested
here" stays visible.

### Architecture audit findings (whole-system pass, after all 11 items)

18. **Cross-origin eviction was spuriously rejected at full capacity — §5g's
    mechanism broke exactly under load.** Eviction is deliberately
    ASYNCHRONOUS (a connection thread must not touch the model, §7), but
    admission ran immediately on the connection thread. Measured with every
    slot occupied: the new-origin session was refused "no free session slots"
    while the slot it needed belonged to the session just condemned, released
    one round later. Self-inflicted, and worst in the case §5g exists for.
    Fixed with `wait_for_teardown()`, bounded and blocking only a client-pool
    thread, which §7 calls a waiting room rather than compute. Covered by new
    test 64.

19. **The engine thread had no crash protection.** An unhandled exception in
    a round killed it silently. The socket stays open and the server keeps
    ACCEPTING, so it looks healthy while serving nothing, and every session
    hangs until the browser's 60s read timeout. Now logged and survived, with
    a consecutive-failure cap so a systematic fault stops rather than spins.
    Covered by new test 65.

20. **`foreground_tab_id` had no staleness timeout (§5f, test 58).** If the
    control connection died, the last value was frozen forever — and a frozen
    key naming a now-hidden tab grants that tab §9a's UNCONDITIONAL admission
    every round, permanently. The engine now degrades to "no foreground" after
    `STALE_VISIBILITY_TIMEOUT`, which is the safe direction: it costs priority,
    it cannot break the latency bound. The raw key is never mutated, so a
    reconnect restores it immediately. Test 58 moves from browser-only to
    executed.

21. **One documented exception to "no model calls off the engine thread":**
    `ChatFormatter.__init__` calls `llama_model_chat_template` from a
    connection thread. Checked rather than assumed — it takes a `const
    llama_model *` and returns `const char *`, a pure read of immutable model
    metadata with no context involved, so concurrent reads are safe. Every
    other model call is on the engine thread.

## First compile of the browser-side C++

The C++ had never been through a compiler. The first full build stopped after
194 of 22,516 steps on a single failing target; two real defects came out of
it, both fixed and each verified by recompiling the affected object.

22. **`malabr_feature` in `chrome/browser/BUILD.gn` declared only `//base`.**
    `malabr_manager.cc` includes browser-UI, extensions, content, sessions and
    net headers, and the UI headers reach Skia transitively — so the target
    failed with `'include/core/SkAlphaType.h' file not found`, which looks like
    a Skia problem and is actually a missing dependency. Added `//chrome/common`,
    `//components/sessions`, `//content/public/browser`, `//extensions/browser`,
    `//extensions/common`, `//net` and `//skia`. `gn gen` confirms no circular
    dependency, and the object now compiles. Sibling targets in the same file
    (`display_file_feature`) already follow this pattern; this one had been left
    behind.

23. **§5a's visibility snippet does not compile on this Chromium revision.**
    §5a shows
    `rfh->GetVisibilityState() == content::PageVisibilityState::kVisible`.
    There is no `content::PageVisibilityState`:
    `RenderFrameHost::GetVisibilityState()` returns
    `blink::mojom::PageVisibilityState`, and `render_frame_host.h` includes only
    its `-forward.h`, so the type is incomplete at the use site. Using it would
    need a blink mojom dependency `extensions/browser` should not take on.
    Replaced with `web_contents->GetVisibility() == content::Visibility::VISIBLE`
    — which is what §5a's own RESOLVED rule names, needs no new dependency, and
    reuses the `WebContents` already fetched and null-checked a few lines above
    for the tab id. **Recommend correcting §5a's code snippet.**

All four malabr objects (`malabr_manager`, `malabr_api`, `mserver_uds`,
`msocket_uds`) now compile. The remaining ~22,300 steps of the full build are
untouched Chromium and have not been run to completion.

24. **Cold start is ~130s, not the ~13s §10 assumes, and nothing retried the
    connect.** Measured by starting `app.py` with the SHIPPED DEFAULTS
    (n_ctx=16384, n_seq_max=8, no cached calibration) rather than the reduced
    settings every earlier test used: the socket appears after **130 seconds**.
    §10 estimates "~13s (model load + calibration)" — a 10x underestimate, with
    calibration dominating. Once its result is cached on disk later starts are
    quick, but a fresh profile pays the full cost.

    Worse, §10 also requires "a short retry-with-backoff inside `Send()`'s
    `Connect()`" and that was **never implemented**: `MServerUDS::Send` called
    `Connect()` exactly once, so every `generate()` issued during those 130
    seconds failed outright. The jittered backoff that does exist covers only
    the control connection, not request sockets. Added a 180s jittered retry
    budget sized from the measurement rather than from the estimate.
    **Recommend correcting §10's cold-start figure.**

    Worth revisiting later: §11c's own audit says isolation and
    browser-protection do NOT depend on calibration, only conversation length
    and speed do. So the server could bind immediately with the conservative
    fallback curve and calibrate in the background, swapping the measured curve
    in when ready. Not done here because calibration and the engine would then
    share the model context concurrently, which is exactly the thread-safety
    problem correction 2 exists to prevent.

25. **The aggregate CPU ceiling is never applied — the easy half of the two-layer
    cap is the missing one.** cgroups are process-granular; they bound what the
    whole inference process may take and cannot see inside it, because a
    `seq_id` is not a process. That asymmetry is the project's premise: the OS
    supplies the outer ceiling, MALABR divides what sits inside it.

    §11 requires BOTH: "a real cgroup cpu.max quota on the process, AND set
    n_threads to match... setting one without the other is the nonlinear-loss
    regime measured above." Only `n_threads` is implemented. `config.py`
    computes `quota_pct`, calibration records it, comments throughout refer to
    "the cgroup limit" — but nothing calls `systemd-run --scope -p CPUQuota=`
    or writes `cpu.max`, and `run_malabr.sh` does not either. So CPU is bounded
    today only by `n_threads=3`, a soft limit: three threads can saturate three
    of four cores and the kernel will not intervene.

    The mechanism itself is verified working on this machine, no root needed:
    an unthrottled busy loop uses 99% CPU; the same loop under
    `systemd-run --user --scope -p CPUQuota=25%` uses 25%, with wall time
    unchanged. Note `cgroup.controllers` in our own scope lists only
    `memory pids`, so writing `cpu.max` directly is not possible — the
    `cpu` controller is not delegated. systemd-run is the working path.

    NOT implemented here because the fix touches process lifecycle:
    `MalabrManager` spawns `python3 app.py` and later calls `Terminate(pid)` on
    that handle, so re-execing under a transient scope changes the PID and the
    handle may no longer reach the real process. Needs a termination test
    alongside it. **Recommend §11 note that only half the cap is built.**

26. **Memory needs no cgroup, and that is a structural result rather than an
    omission.** §11 measured RSS flat (~1139MB) from 1 to 8 resident sessions:
    `n_ctx` is a single fixed allocation at startup with no runtime path to
    grow. A `memory.max` on top would be redundant, since the allocation cannot
    exceed itself. Memory is therefore capped exactly at BOTH granularities —
    aggregate by construction, per-session by the `n_ctx / n_seq_max` budget
    plus compaction at 95%. CPU is the asymmetric case: the per-session
    division exists, the aggregate ceiling does not.

27. **Resource monopolisation belongs in §11c's calibration-INDEPENDENT column.**
    §11c lists isolation and browser-protection as not depending on
    calibration, and conversation length and speed as depending on it.
    Monopolisation resistance belongs with the former, and this was measured
    rather than argued. One session at position 4000 against five shallow ones,
    300 rounds, cost model swept across a 1000x error range:

        accurate              deep session took  9.1% of slots, nobody starved
        10x too optimistic                      16.7%,           nobody starved
        100x too pessimistic                    16.9%,           nobody starved
        no calibration at all                   18.0%,           nobody starved

    Fair share is 16.7%. What the cost model's accuracy actually buys is
    proportional charging of expensive sessions (the accurate run gives the deep
    session LESS than fair share, correctly); as the model degrades the
    scheduler stops discriminating and converges to round-robin. It never
    permits monopolisation, because the anti-monopolisation property is
    structural: the loop yields after every single token, `ABSOLUTE_CEILING`
    bounds one response, and the aging pass counts rounds rather than
    milliseconds. None of those take a calibration input.

28. **There is no user-initiated stop, and the API cannot express one.**
    `malabr.idl` exposes exactly one function, `generate()`. A turn ends by
    reaching EOS, hitting the output cap, being superseded by the next prompt,
    or the tab closing/navigating. A user who simply wants to stop a running
    response — the Stop button every comparable chat UI has — has no way to say
    so except by sending another prompt, which replaces rather than cancels and
    puts a new turn into context.

    Noticed while using the panel, not by reading the spec. The server side is
    already capable: §6b's rule that "a turn only enters permanent context if it
    reaches EOS or the output cap" describes precisely what a stop must do, and
    `_roll_back_partial()` implements it — cancellation is reachable today only
    through tab-close and supersede. What is missing is a way to ask for it.

    Not a UI patch: it needs a new IDL function (`cancel(requestId)`), a
    corresponding ExtensionFunction class, a histogram enum value, and a route
    to carry it — either a fifth control message or a per-request signal.
    Worth deciding deliberately, since a Stop that leaves a half-finished
    assistant turn in the KV cache would reintroduce exactly the desync §6b
    exists to prevent.

29. **The panel must not disable input during generation — supersede is the
    designed behaviour.** An earlier version of the test extension greyed the
    Send button out while a response streamed, but left the Enter key wired to
    the same handler, so Enter did what the disabled button said was
    impossible. The second request then succeeded, because §6b's single-flight
    replace handled it correctly. The server was right and the UI was lying.
    The button now becomes "Replace" during generation, and a superseded turn
    is reported as an ordinary outcome rather than an error.

30. **`MalabrFeature` is disabled by default and the launcher never enabled it,
    so nothing ran at all.** `kMalabrFeature` is `FEATURE_DISABLED_BY_DEFAULT`
    (chrome/common/chrome_features.cc) and is the first thing
    `MalabrManager::StartMLServerIfEnabled()` checks. `run_malabr.sh` enabled
    only `MalabrTunables`, which is a DIFFERENT feature carrying the timeout
    parameters — so the manager returned immediately on every launch: no server
    spawned, no socket created, and every `generate()` failing with nothing in
    the log, because nothing was ever attempted.

    Worth noting how it presented. Two independent faults were stacked here:
    this one, and the interpreter (correction 31 below). Both produce the same
    visible symptom — an empty chat panel — and the second was invisible until
    the first was fixed. The absence of any log line was itself the clue: a
    failed spawn would have logged, a failed connect would have logged, and
    silence meant the guard.

31. **The spawned interpreter must be configurable; `python3` is the wrong
    one.** `MalabrManager` launched `base::FilePath("python3")`, which resolves
    through PATH. In a Chromium build shell that is the build environment's
    python, which has no `llama_cpp`, so `app.py` exited immediately with
    `ModuleNotFoundError`. The socket path was already an environment variable
    for exactly this class of reason; the interpreter now is too, via
    `MALABR_PYTHON`, with `run_malabr.sh` exporting the one that carries the
    runtime. **Recommend §10 name this alongside the socket path.**

32. **Reasoning tokens are suppressed at the PROMPT, not at the stream.**
    Qwen3 emits a visible chain of thought before its answer. Filtering that in
    the UI or the streaming layer would still generate every one of those
    tokens, so they would consume the per-request output cap, the session's
    context budget and wall-clock time, and then be thrown away. The template
    itself has the switch:

        {%- if enable_thinking is defined and enable_thinking is false %}
            {{- '<think>\n\n</think>\n\n' }}

    i.e. it pre-fills an already-closed think block. `llama_chat_apply_template`
    cannot pass template VARIABLES, only messages, so `ChatFormatter` READS
    that literal out of the template source rather than hardcoding it. A model
    whose template has no such branch gets "" and is unaffected — verified:
    Qwen3 yields `'<think>\n\n</think>\n\n'`, gemma-3 yields `''`.

    The marker is recorded as part of the ASSISTANT message, not appended only
    to `_rendered`. In KV terms that is what it is — those tokens sit inside the
    assistant block ahead of the generated text — and storing it there keeps
    `_apply()`'s output matching the cache on the next turn. A first attempt
    appended it to `_rendered` alone, so the re-render no longer contained it
    and the prefix check failed on turn two, breaking 11 of the §12 tests.

33. **A test that passed by accident: §12 test 19's precondition was implicit.**
    It installed its bounded outbox after exactly ONE engine step, assuming
    prefill had completed. That held only while the prompt fitted in a single
    round. Adding six tokens of no-think marker pushed prefill into a second
    round, so the session was still PENDING and the stalled-reader path was
    never exercised at all — the test failed for the right reason. It now drives
    until the session is demonstrably GENERATING and asserts that precondition
    before proceeding.

## First live browser session

The full path works end to end: content script -> browser process -> UDS ->
Python engine -> streamed tokens back into the page. Multi-turn context is
confirmed working live, which validates §6c's incremental template application
against a real conversation rather than a harness: told "my name is chaitanya"
and asked "what is my name" two turns later, the model answered correctly, so
the session's KV cache genuinely persisted across turns.

Three faults had to be cleared to get there, and two of them produced the SAME
symptom — an empty chat panel — which is why they had to be found in order:
`MalabrFeature` disabled by default (nothing was attempted at all), the spawned
interpreter lacking llama_cpp (server died instantly), and the test extension
still calling the removed sklearn API.


## Code rationale, by module

The long "why" behind the code lives here rather than inline, so the modules
read as code. Each entry is keyed `module.Class.method`; the code carries a
one-line hint ending in `[notes: module.Class.method]` or a docstring line
`Rationale: implementation_notes.md, module.name` at the spot it came from.
Text is verbatim from the original comments and docstrings.

### slots

#### slots.(module)

See design_doc/implementation_notes.md, 'Code rationale: slots'.

#### slots.SlotAllocator

The isolation rule, stated once because it is the whole design: WIPE ON
ACQUIRE, not only on release. A release can be skipped -- a bug, or a crash
between release and reuse. An acquire cannot: a session cannot exist without
passing through it. Putting the safety-critical step where it cannot be
skipped turns a missed release into a harmless inefficiency instead of a
cross-session data leak.

Measured, not assumed: a slot written to and handed back without a wipe
still reports llama_memory_seq_pos_max() == 12 for a 13-token conversation.
The KV really does persist; this class is what stops the next session
reading it.

THREAD SPLIT -- the non-obvious part, and a correction to section 7.
Section 7's sketch has acquire() call llama_memory_seq_rm directly, while
its own concurrency note says connection threads create sessions
concurrently. Those two statements cannot both hold. llama.h documents "The
API is thread-safe" exactly once, scoped to the Tokenization section; the
Memory section carries no such guarantee. Mutating KV from a connection
thread while the engine thread is inside llama_decode() on the same context
is therefore an undocumented data race, and section 7 separately names
single-threadedness as a load-bearing invariant.

So the work is split by thread, and the split is enforced, not documented:
  - acquire() / release()  -- ANY thread. Pure bookkeeping under a lock.
                              Touches no model state whatsoever.
  - prepare(slot)          -- ENGINE THREAD ONLY. Does the actual wipe.
  - assert_ready(slot)     -- the guard the decode path calls, which makes
                              "no token is ever decoded into an unwiped
                              slot" a checked property rather than a hope.

A slot handed out by acquire() is NOT yet safe to use. It carries a pending
wipe until the engine thread clears it. That is why every slot in _free is
treated as dirty regardless of how it got there.

#### slots.SlotAllocator.acquire

The returned slot is NOT usable yet -- it carries a pending wipe that
the engine thread must clear via prepare(). No model state is touched
here, deliberately: see the THREAD SPLIT note above.

#### slots.SlotAllocator.release

There is deliberately no wipe here. Section 7's sketch wiped on release
too, "belt and braces" -- but that wipe would have to run on a
connection thread, which is exactly the race described above. Dropping
it costs nothing, because the whole rationale for wipe-on-acquire is
that release cannot be trusted to happen at all. Every slot in _free is
treated as dirty regardless.

Double release, or a slot never acquired. Returning it to
_free would put one slot in the list twice, and two sessions
would then be handed the same KV sequence -- the exact leak
this class exists to prevent. Refuse instead.

#### slots.SlotAllocator.prepare

MUST be called on the engine thread, before the first decode into this
slot. Raises SlotWipeError if the slot cannot be proven empty, in which
case the slot is quarantined and never reused.

#### slots.SlotAllocator.assert_ready

This is what turns "we wipe before use" from a convention into a checked
invariant. A missed prepare() becomes a loud error at the decode call
instead of a silent cross-session KV leak.

#### slots.SlotAllocator.__init__

A lock is required, not defensive: connection threads create sessions
concurrently (one per tab, and tabs arrive together after a window
switch).

MEASURED, and NOT the failure mode first assumed here. An earlier
version of this comment claimed an unlocked pop() hands two tabs the
SAME slot. That is false -- list.pop() is atomic under the GIL, and a
32-thread x 20-trial probe produced zero duplicates with the lock
removed. The real race is the CHECK-THEN-ACT pair in acquire():
threads all pass "if not self._free", then race to pop an emptied
list. With the window widened to 2ms, no-lock produced 120 IndexErrors
across 160 acquires; with the lock, zero. So the damage is a crash in
session creation for a request that should have been cleanly rejected
as "no capacity" -- not a cross-session leak.

Slots whose wipe could not be verified. Deliberately leaked rather
than reused: losing capacity is recoverable, leaking a conversation
into another origin's session is not.

#### slots.SlotAllocator._wipe_and_verify

llama_memory_seq_rm is declared to return bool. On this model every
call returned True (verified: full, partial, and empty-slot removal),
so this branch is defensive rather than observed-necessary. It is
checked because llama.cpp returns false where partial removal is
unsupported -- the sliding-window-attention case, which is exactly
what section 8 compaction will exercise on models like gemma-3.

Independent confirmation. Trusting the return code alone would mean
trusting one bool; this asks the memory itself whether anything is
left. -1 is llama.cpp's "no positions in this sequence".

### formatter

#### formatter.(module)

See design_doc/implementation_notes.md, 'Code rationale: formatter'.

#### formatter.ChatFormatter

Sessions keep their KV cache resident so each turn prefills only the NEW
tokens. Re-rendering and re-prefilling the whole history every turn would
defeat that entirely. So this class tracks exactly what text is already
represented in the KV and hands back only the delta.

Model-agnostic BY CONSTRUCTION. An earlier draft of section 6c specified
appending a hardcoded '<|im_start|>{role}\n{content}<|im_end|>\n' fragment.
That is ChatML, i.e. Qwen-specific -- it would silently produce malformed
structure on gemma-3, whose template uses <start_of_turn>. Instead the delta
is computed FROM the model's own template: render the full conversation, and
take the suffix past what is already rendered. The template is the single
source of truth and no marker is hardcoded anywhere.

Why the delta can be tokenized on its own, which is the non-obvious part:
BPE merges across concatenation boundaries in general -- measured,
tok("hell")+tok("o") = [56095, 78] but tok("hello") = [14990]. Tokenizing a
delta separately would therefore normally be unsafe. It is safe here only
because every turn boundary begins at a SPECIAL token (the turn terminator),
and special tokens are hard boundaries the BPE merge never crosses --
verified: splitting 'I am Qwen.<|im_end|>' at the special token yields
identical ids. verify_against_full() re-checks this property rather than
trusting it.

#### formatter.is_stop_token

Uses llama_vocab_is_eog, NOT a comparison against llama_vocab_eos. Measured
on Qwen3-0.6B: eos() returns only <|im_end|> (151645), but SIX tokens are
flagged end-of-generation -- </s>, <|endoftext|>, <|im_end|>, <|fim_pad|>,
<|repo_name|>, <|file_sep|>. Checking eos alone would miss five of them and
the model would run on until the output cap instead of ending the turn.

#### formatter.Utf8Streamer

Measured, not hypothetical: scanning the first 20,000 vocabulary entries,
282 tokens (~1.4%) produce bytes that are NOT valid UTF-8 standalone -- e.g.
token 94 -> b'\xa1', one piece of a multi-byte character from BPE's
byte-level fallback. Emitting each token's bytes as produced means any
non-English text, many symbols, or emoji eventually splits a character
across two frames, and the browser-side decoder shows a replacement
character or throws.

So: accumulate bytes, emit only the prefix that decodes cleanly, and hold
the trailing partial bytes for the next token.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 6d -- UTF-8 safe streaming
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

A UTF-8 character is at most 4 bytes, so a legitimate partial sequence can
never exceed 3 held bytes. Anything longer is genuinely malformed output
rather than an incomplete character, and holding it forever would stall
the stream silently -- flush it lossily instead of hanging.

#### formatter.ChatFormatter._extract_no_think_suffix

        Reasoning models emit a visible chain of thought before the answer.
        That is not merely noise in the UI: those tokens are generated, so they
        consume the per-request output cap, the session's context budget and
        wall-clock time. Suppressing them downstream (in the streamer or the
        page) would pay all three costs and then throw the result away.
        Suppressing them at the prompt means they are never produced.

        Qwen3's template does this with
            {%- if enable_thinking is defined and enable_thinking is false %}
                {{- '<think>

</think>

' }}
        i.e. it pre-fills an already-closed think block so the model treats
        reasoning as finished. llama_chat_apply_template cannot pass template
        VARIABLES, only messages, so the suffix is READ OUT of the template
        source instead of hardcoded -- a model whose template has no such
        branch simply gets "" and is unaffected.
        

#### formatter.ChatFormatter.assistant_generated

The generated tokens are already in the KV, so this adds no tokens. It
only keeps _rendered in step with reality. Note the KV does NOT contain
the turn terminator: generation stops AT the end-of-generation token and
that token is never decoded. The next user_turn's delta therefore begins
with the terminator, which is exactly what makes that delta start on a
special token.

The no-think marker is recorded as part of what the assistant said,
because in KV terms that is exactly what it is: those tokens sit
inside the assistant block, ahead of the generated text. Storing it
here rather than special-casing every render keeps _apply()'s output
matching the cache on the NEXT turn -- an earlier version appended it
only to _rendered, so the re-render no longer had it and the prefix
check failed on turn two.

#### formatter.ChatFormatter._expected_render

Phase-dependent, and the two cases are legitimately different -- an
earlier version compared against the wrong one and reported a false
divergence. After a completed assistant turn the KV holds the full
render up to and including the user turn plus the generated text, but
NOT the turn terminator (generation stops AT the end-of-generation
token and never decodes it) and NOT the next generation prompt.

An empty conversation means an empty KV. The template still emits
a bare generation prompt ('<|im_start|>assistant\n' on Qwen3) for
zero messages, and returning that would claim content the cache
does not hold -- which breaks the prefix check on the very next
turn. Rolling a session's first turn back is exactly this case.

#### formatter.ChatFormatter.drop_messages

Section 8 specifies compaction entirely in terms of KV positions and
never mentions this. That is the same gap section 6b had: the formatter
is a SECOND per-session state holding the conversation, and a KV
mutation that does not update it leaves _rendered describing content the
model no longer has. The next turn is then built against a conversation
that does not exist.

#### formatter.ChatFormatter.checkpoint

Section 6b specifies rollback purely as KV positions. It predates
section 6c, which introduced a SECOND piece of per-session state -- the
rendered conversation -- that must roll back in lockstep. Rolling back
one without the other desyncs the formatter from the KV, and the next
turn is built on a conversation the model never saw.

A MESSAGE COUNT, not a (count, rendered_length) pair. The length form
was wrong for the same reason section 8 gives about absolute positions:
a compaction firing while the checkpoint is live shortens _rendered
underneath it, and restoring to the old length then leaves the
formatter describing text that no longer exists. A count survives that,
because compact() can shift it exactly as it shifts every position.

#### formatter.ChatFormatter.verify_against_full

Section 6c only ever compared strings. The KV holds tokens, and BPE can
merge across boundaries, so string equality does not imply token
equality. This checks the property that actually matters.

#### formatter.Utf8Streamer.flush

Trailing bytes here mean generation stopped mid-character. Showing a
replacement character is more honest than silently dropping output.

#### formatter.ChatFormatter._tokenize

add_special controls BOS. llama_chat_apply_template renders the
template TEXT but never emits the actual BOS token bytes ({{ bos_token
}} is a HuggingFace-ism its engine drops), so BOS has to come from
here -- and only on the very first delta of a conversation. This still
honours the model's own tokenizer.ggml.add_bos_token flag: it is a
no-op for models like Qwen3 that set it false, and prepends <bos> for
models like gemma-3 that require it. Without it gemma-3 loses track of
who is speaking and answers as if it were the user.

#### formatter.ChatFormatter.user_turn

Load-bearing invariant, checked rather than assumed: everything already
in the KV must still be a prefix of the newly rendered conversation. If
a template ever violates this (a summarising or history-rewriting
template would), incremental prefill is invalid and the KV would
silently disagree with what the model thinks it has seen. Fail loudly
instead -- this is the "subtly wrong output" class, not a crash class.

#### formatter.Utf8Streamer.push

Find the longest prefix that is valid UTF-8. Decoding the whole buffer
and catching the error tells us exactly where the good prefix ends,
which is cheaper and more precise than scanning byte patterns.

### session

#### session.(module)

See design_doc/implementation_notes.md, 'Code rationale: session'.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sections 6 / 6b / 7 -- session state and the single-threaded engine loop
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 8 input cap. RESERVED_FOR_RESPONSE guarantees room is left for the
model to ANSWER, not merely to fit the question -- without it a prompt could
legally consume the entire budget and leave nothing to reply with.

Section 5d: two sampling configs, deliberately separate rather than one shared
default. Canary/fidelity tests (§12 tests 1,4,18,27,32,40) assume deterministic
output -- with any randomness they become probabilistic rather than pass/fail.
Real chat must NOT be greedy: argmax produces flat, repetitive text. The GGUF
carries no sampling defaults (25 metadata keys scanned, none sampling-related),

#### session.OutputCap

A FLAT cap is wrong, and this is the one number the measurements most
directly contradict: decode runs at 48.3 tok/s at position 64 but 5.2 tok/s
at position 6000. A flat 512-token cap therefore costs ~11s early in a
conversation and ~98s deep into one -- the same number meaning wildly
different wall-clock time.

Calibration (Phase D) hands over a FINISHED table; the engine never derives
caps from raw curve data at runtime (section 12 test 31).

#### session.Turn

MUTABLE on purpose. Section 8's position-shift fix has to write corrected
positions back into entries still in the list; tuples cannot do that, and
the bug it fixes is precisely that other turns kept stale positions.

Range is [start, end): from the first token of the user delta to the last
token of the response. That boundary is not arbitrary -- every delta begins
with the terminator that CLOSES the preceding assistant block (a
consequence of section 6c deriving deltas from the template). So dropping a
whole exchange leaves the survivor's assistant block to be closed by the
NEXT surviving delta, and the result is well-formed with no repair step.

#### session.Session

Identity is (extension_id, tab_id, origin) -- origin included because
without it, navigating a tab from a bank site to another site let the new
site's content script inherit a session still holding the bank
conversation (section 5g).

#### session.Session.emit

Section 7 considered three policies and only one is defensible:
blocking the engine stalls the single shared execution slot for every
other session over one slow reader; dropping tokens silently corrupts
the response with no indication; so a stalled reader is treated exactly
like a dead one and routed through the ordinary teardown path.

#### session.Session.terminate

Section 10a rule 2: a cancelled request MUST produce a terminal frame.
Without one the browser waits out its 60s SO_RCVTIMEO instead of ending
promptly. That makes this the one emission that must not fail because
the queue is full -- the whole point is to unblock a stuck reader, so
the bound that protects against a stuck reader cannot be allowed to
prevent it.

#### session.OutputCap.__init__

table: sorted [(position, cap)]. None => no calibration data yet, so
fall back to the floor rather than guessing high. Being too
conservative truncates a reply; being too generous blows the latency
budget the cap exists to enforce.

#### session.Session.__init__

PER-REQUEST, not per-session -- a correction to §7, which calls this
"the session's outbox". Under §6b's single-flight replace TWO handlers
are briefly alive: the superseded one waiting for its terminal frame,
and the new one waiting for tokens. One shared queue means whichever
polls first steals the other's frames -- the superseded client could
receive the new response, or hang until its 60s read timeout. Each
request gets its own queue; the engine writes to whichever is current.

Section 6b's TWO snapshots. One is not enough: pos_before_generation
is right for interrupting a response already streaming, but a replace
arriving DURING prefill of a large prompt has no earlier point to roll
back to. Both are absolute positions, and section 8's compact() owns
shifting them -- if that shift is ever skipped, rollback silently
targets the wrong position.

The formatter's matching checkpoint. Must be captured and restored at
exactly the same moments as pos_before_request, or the two states
diverge -- see ChatFormatter.checkpoint().

Section 8: completed exchanges, oldest first. turn_boundaries[0] is
the ANCHOR -- kept always, because it carries the template's one-time
system/tools preamble and StreamingLLM's finding that the first ~32
tokens act as attention anchors whose loss degrades output sharply.

Partitioned KV: the hard slice n_ctx/n_seq_max. Shared KV: a SOFTER
cap (n_ctx/2 by default) -- the engine's aggregate guard is the real
bound. Passed in from config so it tracks n_ctx / n_seq_max instead of
a constant that silently goes stale when either changes.

§9b: consecutive rounds a PENDING session was skipped because the
leftover budget could not fund a minimum-size chunk. Not in §9b --
see build_batch for the starvation this prevents.

### scheduler

#### scheduler.(module)

See design_doc/implementation_notes.md, 'Code rationale: scheduler'.

§5f degraded mode: how long a dead control connection may go before the
foreground key is treated as stale and the engine falls back to uniform
treatment.

#### scheduler.CostCurve

Two statistics from the same data, for two different purposes -- §11a's own
rule. The MEDIAN feeds representative things like the output-cap formula.
The WORST-OBSERVED feeds hard cutoffs like batch admission, because the
measured trial-to-trial spread is real (up to ~19% at short context) and a
round estimated from the median could quietly run 20% over the bound it
exists to enforce.

#### scheduler.build_batch

Returns (decode_picks, prefill_chunks, estimated_ms).

§7's original slot-count split could never bind: BATCH_SIZE defaulted to
n_seq_max and admission is already capped at n_seq_max, so every runnable
session always fit in one batch. Worse, there is normally exactly ONE
foreground session, so a 50/50 split left foreground's spare slots to be
donated to background -- the reverse of the intended priority.

Batching also does not make mixed-depth sessions cheaper to share a round:
one batched llama_decode is a single synchronous pass whose cost is the SUM
of every member's KV-read, not the max. Measured: 4 sessions at depth 1500
gave 12.5 tok/s aggregate, 3.1 each -- worse than one session's solo 25.1
at that depth. A shallow foreground session sharing a round with a deep
background one inherits the deep one's cost.

§5f: foreground is ONE tab id, re-read fresh every round, never cached.
At most one TAB can be foreground by construction; >1 session only if two
extensions share that tab.

Foreground first and UNCONDITIONALLY: the first one is admitted even if it
alone exceeds the budget, or a deep foreground session could never run.

Ordered by rounds_excluded, for the two-extensions-on-one-tab case where
fg has two members. Without this the SAME one always took the
unconditional pick, and if it alone blew the budget the other could never
satisfy c <= budget -- and was never aged either, because the aging pass
below only looked at bg and rounds_excluded was reset for every fg
session whether it ran or not. Permanent starvation, the same class §9a's
aging fixes for bg-vs-bg. Giving the most-passed-over fg session the
unconditional pick makes the two alternate instead.

AGING PASS -- before cheapest-first gets to pass over the same sessions
again. Without it a moderately expensive bg session loses to the same
cheaper ones every round forever: real starvation, merely moved from
fg-vs-bg to bg-vs-bg. Drawn from every unpicked runnable session, so a
passed-over foreground member gets the same escape hatch.

"or not picks" is a CORRECTION to §9a, not a restatement of it. §9a's
prose says a deep session "simply runs alone in its own round,
spending the whole budget on itself, which harms nobody else" -- but
its code gives that unconditional-first-pick escape ONLY to
foreground. Measured consequence: a background session costing more
than the entire budget (100ms at pos 6000 vs a 50ms round) is excluded
EVERY round forever, aging included, because c <= budget can never
hold. 60/60 rounds excluded with no foreground even present.

Granting aged background the same escape makes the prose true and
bounds the overrun to one session's cost in a round where it runs
alone -- which is exactly what §9a says should happen.

NORMAL FILL -- cheapest-first. Arrival order (FIFO) would let whichever
session asked first consume the whole budget alone, stranding several
cheap sessions that would collectively have fit.

-- §9b: prefill fills whatever budget is LEFT ------------------------
Decode is admitted first on purpose: a token owed to a session already
mid-response is more latency-sensitive than starting a new one, and it
keeps §9a's foreground guarantee untouched.

DIVERGENCE FROM §9b -- it says "if n < PREFILL_CHUNK_MIN and
n < remaining: continue  # wait for a rounder budget". Taken
literally that STARVES: if decode picks keep leaving less than a
minimum chunk's worth of budget, the condition holds every round and
the prompt is never prefilled at all. §9b bounds decode starvation
with an aging pass but leaves prefill unbounded. Same remedy: after
MAX_PREFILL_STALLS skipped rounds, force one minimum-size chunk
through even though the budget does not cover it. That overruns the
bound by at most one minimum chunk, which is finite and bounded --
unlike never answering the user at all.

Admit what the budget CAN afford, not a full minimum chunk.
Forcing PREFILL_CHUNK_MIN through was measured to overrun by
87ms against a 50ms budget, in 20% of rounds -- it broke the
very bound §9a/§6a exist to hold, to fix a starvation problem.
PREFILL_CHUNK_MIN is an EFFICIENCY floor ("below this, per-call
overhead dominates"), not a correctness one, so trading a little
efficiency to keep the latency bound is the right way round.

#### scheduler.CostCurve.prefill_ms

Decode is memory-bandwidth-bound -- one token, but every prior K/V
vector is read, which is why the decode curve collapses 48 -> 5 tok/s
with depth. Prefill is compute-bound and parallel: many tokens in one
pass amortising the same weight read, typically an order of magnitude
faster and scaling differently with depth.

#### scheduler.CostCurve.observe_round

This project has already been burned by this exact class of assumption:
Phase C's naive extrapolation predicted ~41 tok/s where the real joint
measurement gave 12.5 -- a 3x error in the OPTIMISTIC direction. Nothing
else stops that recurring here, and it would fail silently, with rounds
simply running long while the code believed they fit.

Floor of 1.0 is deliberate: the loop may only make estimates MORE
conservative. An optimistic correction would let a lucky run of fast
rounds widen batches until the bound breaks -- the exact failure this
defends against. The ceiling stops one pathological measurement from
wedging the engine into admitting nobody, ever.

#### scheduler.CostCurve._raw_worst

No calibration yet. Assume the WHOLE budget per token: the most
conservative possible estimate, so an uncalibrated engine degrades
to one session per round rather than over-admitting on a guess.

#### scheduler.CostCurve.prefill_tokens_affordable

Uncalibrated. Returning 0 here would mean a PENDING session is
NEVER prefilled -- the engine would sit with an unanswerable
prompt, rescued only after MAX_PREFILL_STALLS rounds by the aging
path. One minimum chunk per round is the honest conservative
behaviour, and matches what prefill_ms() charges.

### engine

#### engine.(module)

The engine is split by the design's own build order:
  slots.py      SlotAllocator + wipe-on-acquire        <- isolation
  formatter.py  chat template application, UTF-8 streaming
  session.py    Session, Turn, OutputCap
  scheduler.py  CostCurve, build_batch
  engine.py     Engine: the loop, compaction, the aggregate guard

Every name is re-exported here so `from malabr_service import engine as eng`
still reaches all of them.

#### engine.Engine

Single-threadedness is a NAMED INVARIANT, not incidental. It is what makes
mid-batch cancellation impossible by construction: a session flipped to
cancelled is excluded from selection entirely, before any batch is composed.
Any new periodic mechanism must run inside this loop, never on a timer
thread -- and that includes the slot wipe, which is why SlotAllocator splits
prepare() (engine thread) from acquire() (any thread).

#### engine.Engine.get_or_create

"Look up, and if absent create" must not be two steps -- two tabs
arriving together would otherwise both find nothing and both create,
and one of the two slots would leak with a session nobody can reach.

#### engine.Engine.evict_other_origins

This is what makes cross-origin isolation work with no navigation
observer at all -- the next request from that tab simply carries a
different origin, and the old session cannot survive it.

#### engine.Engine.effective_foreground_tab_id

Read fresh every round, never cached. Returns -1 (no foreground) when
the control connection has been down longer than
STALE_VISIBILITY_TIMEOUT, because a stale key is worse than none.

#### engine.Engine.keys_for_extension

Tab-close handles one session at a time; without this, an uninstalled
extension's sessions would sit holding slots until their tabs happen to
close, which may be never.

#### engine.Engine.wait_for_teardown

Needed because eviction is deliberately ASYNCHRONOUS: cancel() only
sets a flag, and the engine thread does the KV work, because a
connection thread must never touch the model (§7). But admission runs
immediately on the connection thread, so without this the sequence
    evict_other_origins(...) ; get_or_create(...)
rejects a cross-origin navigation with "no free session slots" while
the slot it needs is the condemned session's own, one round from being
released. Measured: with every slot occupied, the new-origin session
was refused and the slot appeared one round later.

Blocking a connection thread is fine here -- §7 calls the client pool a
waiting room, not compute, and it is sized well above n_seq_max.

#### engine.Engine.cancel

The actual KV work happens on the engine thread. That separation is the
same one SlotAllocator enforces, for the same reason.

#### engine.Engine.stop_generation

Distinct from cancel(), which tears the session down for tab close or
eviction. A stop must leave the conversation intact and reusable -- the
user wants this answer to end, not the chat to disappear.

Rolls the partial turn back for the reason section 6b already gives:
a turn enters permanent context ONLY by reaching EOS or the output cap.
A stop that left a half-finished assistant turn in the cache would
desync the model from what the user can see, which is exactly what that
rule exists to prevent.

Flag only -- the rollback itself is engine-thread work.

#### engine.Engine.submit

Section 6b: replaces any generation in flight. Returns None if there is
no such session.

#### engine.Engine._step

Split out from _run so tests can drive the loop deterministically
instead of racing a background thread.

Control flags FIRST, before anything is dispatched. This ordering is
what gives cancellation its <=1-token bound and makes mid-batch
cancellation unrepresentable.

#### engine.Engine._sample_and_emit

Returning after every single token IS the preemption mechanism --
nothing ever commits to more than one token, so a foreground request
arriving mid-background-generation waits at most one round.

#### engine.Engine._roll_back_partial

        DIVERGES FROM SECTION 6b, deliberately. 6b rolls a GENERATING session
        back to pos_before_generation, keeping the user message and the
        generation prompt in KV. That is not a usable boundary: the KV at that
        point ends inside an OPEN assistant block (the template's trailing
        '<|im_start|>assistant
'), so appending a new user turn after it
        produces malformed structure -- which is exactly what the formatter's
        prefix check caught.

        Rolling back to pos_before_request instead is also what 6b's own stated
        rule requires: "a turn only enters permanent context if it reaches EOS
        or the output cap. Any other termination is rolled back -- never
        partially remembered." A turn is the user message AND its response, so
        both go. pos_before_generation is still tracked because section 8's
        compaction has to shift it, and a future resume/regenerate feature
        would need it.
        

No turn is in flight now -- keep pos_before_generation pinned to the
request boundary so it never lingers inside a compactable exchange
(see _finish_turn for the same reasoning).

#### engine.Engine._make_sampler

Not merely tidy: samplers carry state (RNG for dist, and any penalty
samplers added later). A shared chain would couple sessions' sampling
to each other, which is the same class of cross-session bleed the KV
slot wipe exists to prevent -- just in a different piece of state.

#### engine.Engine._decode_batch

API subtlety that cost a crash: llama_get_logits_ith(ctx, i) -- which is
what llama_sampler_sample calls -- takes the index WITHIN THE BATCH, not
the ordinal among tokens that requested logits. llama.cpp maps it through
an internal output_ids table. Passing the compacted ordinal aborts with
GGML_ASSERT(logits != nullptr).

This stayed latent while the engine sampled with index -1 ("last
output"), which sidesteps the question. Batching makes several outputs
per round real, so it had to be got right.

Checked, not ignored. The handoff records two past cases where
an unchecked return code produced physically impossible
numbers; a silent decode failure here would desync s.pos from
the KV and corrupt the conversation with no visible error.

#### engine.Engine.needs_compaction

A correctness requirement, not a safety margin: one batched decode can
advance several sessions' pos at once, so checking after the fact races
the batch -- session B could be one token from its ceiling and get
pushed past it before anything re-checked.

#### engine.Engine.compact

Returns tokens freed. False-y result means nothing was droppable, which
section 8 handles upstream by rejecting oversized input rather than
letting compaction fail and deciding afterwards.

keep_recent=False is the shared-KV aggregate guard's last resort: drop
every exchange except the anchor, so a pool that would otherwise fail a
decode ("no memory slot") still makes room. Costs the most context.

Keep the anchor (index 0); normally keep the most recent exchange too.
The anchor carries the template preamble and the first ~32 tokens act
as attention anchors whose loss degrades output sharply.

Invariant section 8 names but does not assert: nothing live may
sit strictly INSIDE a dropped range. Droppable turns are
fully-closed prior exchanges by construction, never the in-flight
one a snapshot could reference. Assert it rather than assume it --
a violation here silently rolls back to removed content.

THE FIX. Shifting s.pos alone is not enough -- every other absolute
position recorded anywhere refers to the same shifted space, and
each one that is missed silently points at the wrong content.

The formatter is the OTHER state holding this conversation, and
section 8 never mentions it. Dropping KV without dropping the
matching messages leaves _rendered describing content the model no
longer has -- the same gap section 6b had with rollback.

The live rollback checkpoint is ALSO a reference into the message
list, and it goes stale here exactly like a position does. Missing
this made a replace-after-compaction restore to a message count
that no longer existed, and the formatter's own prefix check
caught it as "template broke the prefix property".

#### engine.Engine._relieve_aggregate_pressure

Victim = the largest session ABOVE its fair share (n_ctx/n_seq_max), so
a small or foreground session is never shrunk to feed a greedy one. The
fair shares sum to exactly n_ctx, so an over-limit total always has such
a session -- unless several are stuck at the anchor+one-turn floor, in
which case fall back to the largest droppable one so a decode still
cannot hit "no memory slot".

Compaction could not claw the pool back under n_ctx: the iteration
bound was hit, or every session is down to its anchor. Returning
here would leave the next llama_decode to fail "no memory slot"
and the round to enter the failure-retry loop. Instead reject the
turns that have produced NOTHING yet -- a PENDING session rolls
back cleanly and its client gets one honest "at capacity" frame.

#### engine.Engine.__init__

Shared-KV aggregate governance (§8). Off by default: behaviour is
exactly the partitioned model. On: one shared pool of n_ctx cells,
sessions get `session_budget` as a soft cap, and _relieve_aggregate
keeps Sigma(pos) < n_ctx by compacting the largest over-fair-share
session first.

Section 5f degraded mode. If the control connection goes down, the
last foreground value is FROZEN, and a frozen key naming a
now-hidden tab would grant that tab §9a's unconditional admission
every round, forever. After the timeout we degrade to "no
foreground" -- every session treated uniformly -- which is the safe
direction: it costs priority, it cannot break the latency bound.

#### engine.Engine._run

An unhandled exception here used to kill the engine thread
silently. The socket stays open and the server keeps
ACCEPTING, so it looks healthy while doing nothing, and every
session hangs until the browser's 60s read timeout. Failing
loudly and continuing is strictly better: the round that blew
up is lost, the rest of the engine keeps serving.

Cooperative CPU throttle. llama_decode pegs n_threads cores for
the round's compute; sleeping proportionally afterwards holds
the average near n_threads * cpu_duty, smoothly -- no cgroup,
no launch-path plumbing, and per-token latency scales by
1/cpu_duty predictably instead of the period-freeze a
kernel quota causes.

#### engine.Engine._run_round

§8: the 95% check runs BEFORE composition, never after. One batched
decode advances several sessions' pos at once, so checking afterwards
races the batch -- a session one token from its ceiling gets pushed
past it before anything re-checks.

Shared-KV aggregate guard, same "before composition" reason. With one
shared pool a single session's soft cap can be n_ctx/2, so the sum
across sessions can exceed n_ctx -- and then llama_decode fails with
"no memory slot". Keep Sigma(pos) under n_ctx by compacting.

Each decode pick carried one token AT s.pos; it now occupies that
position. Advancing here, not in _sample_and_emit, keeps pos in step
with what the batch actually wrote -- the sampling that follows reads
logits produced BY these positions.

§9b part 2: feed the REAL round time back. Open-loop, a wrong cost
model silently violates the bound and only a dedicated experiment
would reveal it. Closed-loop, it shrinks batches until reality fits.

#### engine.Engine._apply_control

Section 6b: the old turn is rolled back, never partially
remembered. A turn enters permanent context ONLY by reaching
EOS or the output cap.

Gate 2 (the input cap in _begin_turn) fired. It raises on
purpose -- a loud "something upstream is broken" signal --
but the client must still get ONE terminal frame, or the
browser sits until its 60s read timeout and surfaces only
"read failed ... result -7". Convert the raise into that
frame here; the log line above/below keeps the signal. The
session stays alive -- the input was bad, not the session.

The formatter desynced from the KV (its _rendered is no
longer a prefix of the freshly rendered conversation).
Retrying cannot fix this -- every subsequent turn hits the
same wall -- so end the session cleanly instead of failing
the round forever.

#### engine.Engine._begin_turn

Swap in the queue this request's handler is already holding. Done here
on the engine thread, AFTER any superseded terminal frame has been
written to the OLD queue, so the two never mix.

Snapshot 2 is set for real when prefill completes (see _run_round). Pin
it to the request boundary until then: left holding the PREVIOUS turn's
value it points inside an already-closed exchange, and if the shared-KV
aggregate guard's compact(keep_recent=False) drops that exchange while
this turn is still PENDING, the stale position lands inside the dropped
range and trips compact()'s corruption assert -- wedging the round.

Section 8 gate 2: defense in depth at the point of no return. Gate 1
lives upstream at admission; this one is structurally unskippable,
because no turn can start without passing through here. It RAISES
rather than tolerating the oversized input -- a loud "something
upstream is broken" signal. _apply_control catches the raise and
turns it into the client's terminal frame, so the browser still gets
a clean "prompt is too long" instead of a 60s read timeout.

Shared-KV: s.budget is a soft cap. The real limit is the shared
pool minus what the OTHER sessions are entitled to keep -- their
fair share -- NOT their current size: _relieve_aggregate_pressure
will compact any over-fair-share session down when this turn runs.
Reserving their live pos instead starved a 3rd tab the moment two
others got deep.

#### engine.Engine._finish_turn

Chat templates that trim message content (gemma-3 does: `content |
trim`) drop trailing whitespace the model emitted -- most often when
the OUTPUT CAP cuts a reply mid-flow right after a space or newline.
Left in the KV, those tokens make the formatter's _rendered (trimmed
to match the template) and the KV disagree, and the NEXT turn dies on
the prefix check. Remove them so KV == _rendered.

The reply is ALL whitespace: the template renders it as an
empty assistant message, so every generated token has to leave
the KV. The old `stripped and` guard skipped this case, and
the desync it left killed the session one turn later.

Re-tokenising the concatenated bytes can disagree with the
tokens the model actually sampled where the last real token
touches the whitespace. Trust the diff ONLY when the stripped
tokenisation is a clean prefix of the full one; otherwise a
count would cut into content, so leave the KV alone.

BOOKKEEPING FIRST -- before any emit that can raise OutboxFull on a
stalled reader. If the formatter update below is skipped by such a
raise, the NEXT turn fails the prefix check one turn later, silently.
The Turn's msg_index must be read before assistant_generated() appends
the assistant message.

The C++ discards the FRAME_COMPLETE payload, so "why did it stop"
is invisible to the client. On the output cap (not EOS) send a
marker token first -- the panel strips it and shows a "hit the
length limit" note instead of a reply that just trails off.

The turn is committed; pos_before_generation is no longer an in-flight
marker. Left holding this turn's generation-start position it points
INSIDE the exchange just recorded in turn_boundaries -- and the
shared-KV aggregate guard compacts IDLE sessions too, so its
compact(keep_recent=False) last resort would drop that exchange and
trip compact()'s corruption assert. Pin it back to the request
boundary; _begin_turn / prefill completion set it afresh next turn.

### runtime

#### runtime.(module)

Implements section 10a's three server-side rules:
  1. cross-origin eviction when a session is created
  2. every request ends in exactly ONE terminal frame, cancellation included
  3. reconcile on the control handshake, not only on explicit messages

Section 7: this pool is a WAITING ROOM, not compute. It must sit well above
n_seq_max or it becomes an invisible FIFO gate in front of the scheduler --
a 9th concurrent tab would queue here, unparsed and invisible, even if it is
the visible tab. One line, but load-bearing.

How long a handler waits for one frame before checking whether its session
died underneath it. Bounds the "session torn down by another thread" case;
the terminal frame normally arrives long before this.

#### runtime.PidLock

The inherited code deleted a stale socket file before binding. That is safe
ONLY if the previous process is genuinely dead. If a second app.py is ever
launched while the first still lives -- a retry bug, or a browser crash and
restart that does not guarantee the child died -- the newcomer would delete
the LIVE instance's socket and steal the path, orphaning a process that
still holds sessions and slots nobody can reach. Silently.

So: check a pid file first, and only clear the socket once the owner is
confirmed dead.

#### runtime.ControlReader

A dedicated thread, separate from the request pool, permanently blocked on
recv(). It exists because per-request sockets cannot carry these: an IDLE
session has no open socket at all, so tab-close-while-idle and every
visibility change had no channel to travel on.

Write-only from the browser -- Python never replies.

#### runtime.ControlReader.serve

Only ONE is expected. A second replaces the first, because a browser
that reconnected believes its new connection is authoritative and the
old one is by definition stale.

A malformed control message is not recoverable: we cannot
know where the next message starts in the stream. Drop the
connection and let the browser's jittered reconnect (and
its LIVE_TABS resync) restore correct state.

§5f: start the staleness clock. The browser reconnects with
jitter and resyncs via LIVE_TABS + FOREGROUND, so this is a
window, not a permanent state.

#### runtime.ControlReader.dispatch

Section 10a is explicit that this is defined behaviour, not an error:
the browser does not track which sessions exist, so it will routinely
name tabs we have never seen.

RECONCILE, not replay. A TAB_CLOSED lost while the control
connection was down can NEVER be replayed -- once the tab is gone
the browser has no record it existed. So the browser pushes STATE
and we reap anything not in it.

tab_id -1 means "not tab-scoped" and can never appear in a live
tab list, so it must be exempt or it would be reaped instantly.

#### runtime.MalabrServer._stream

A handler whose session was cancelled must emit a terminal frame and
close, not block waiting for tokens that will never come -- otherwise
the browser sits until its 60s SO_RCVTIMEO instead of ending promptly.

Nothing arrived. If the session died without managing to
enqueue its terminal frame (teardown from another thread,
engine crash), synthesise one rather than hang.

#### runtime.MalabrServer._reexec_with_model

os.execv keeps the SAME pid, so MalabrManager's later Terminate(pid)
still lands on the real process -- the reason a plain re-exec is used
here rather than exit-and-respawn (nothing respawns it) or a transient
systemd scope (that changes the pid).

#### runtime.PidLock.acquire

A pidfile naming OUR OWN pid can only be our re-exec predecessor:
os.execv keeps the pid, and the model switcher relies on that. It
unlinks the pidfile before exec, but that is best-effort (wrapped in
OSError), and if it ever fails the _alive() check below would see the
pid as live -- because it is us -- and refuse to start, leaving the
switch with a dead server. A live foreign instance can never hold our
pid, so this is unambiguously stale: reclaim it.

#### runtime.MalabrServer.__init__

app.main() acquires the pid lock BEFORE the model load so a doomed
duplicate start exits in milliseconds instead of after ~2 minutes of
calibration. It hands that lock in; start() then re-acquires as a
no-op. A caller without one (tests) gets a fresh lock as before.

#### runtime.MalabrServer.start

Only now is it safe to clear the socket: the pid lock has confirmed
no live owner. Doing this first, as the inherited code did, is what
made stealing a live instance's path possible.

#### runtime.MalabrServer.handle_connection

BOUND BEFORE recv_full -- the same rule protocol.py applies to
payload_size. header_len is a raw 4-byte value off the wire; without
this a co-resident peer declares ~4GB and parks a pool thread in
recv() forever. unpack_client_envelope re-checks the length, but only
after the read has already happened.

#### runtime.MalabrServer.handle_generate

Model switcher. The page-facing API is only generate()/stop(), so the
chat panel talks to the switcher THROUGH generate(): a prompt that is
exactly the sentinel is a control command, not a turn. The reply comes
back as ordinary token frames (a JSON blob) so no new C++ route or IDL
function -- and therefore no Chromium rebuild -- is needed.

RULE 1: cross-origin eviction. Creating a session for (ext, tab,
origin) tears down any session with the same (ext, tab) and a
DIFFERENT origin. This is what makes §5g work with no navigation
observer -- the next request from that tab simply carries a different
origin and the old session cannot survive it.

Wait for the eviction we just asked for to actually complete. Without
this, a cross-origin navigation is rejected for "no free slots" while
the slot it needs belongs to the session we just condemned -- and it
is exactly the full-capacity case where that hurts most.

§7's named limitation: admission is not visibility-aware, so a
foreground tab CAN be rejected while background tabs hold slots.
Surfacing it beats failing silently.

Visibility is a SEED for a NEW session only, and only while the
control connection has not told us otherwise. It must never
override live state: §6's ordering rule does not guarantee the
seed is newer than the control channel's view.

#### runtime.MalabrServer._handle_meta

§3: "New chat" is a FULL teardown -- KV cache, session object, and
the panel's display -- not a display clear. The page-facing API is
only generate()/stop() and adding an "end session" verb needs a
Chromium rebuild, so it rides the meta channel like list/switch.
cancel() only flags the teardown (the KV work is engine-thread
only, §7); wait_for_teardown() then blocks this pool thread until
the slot is actually released, so the panel's next generate()
cannot be handed the old session -- and its context -- back.

Acknowledge BEFORE re-execing, so the panel gets a reply on this
connection. The exec then replaces this whole process -- every
session and its KV cache goes with it, which is the accepted cost
of a switch (there is no safe way to carry a KV cache across
models).

### calibration

#### calibration.(module)

Measures this machine rather than trusting numbers measured on another one.
Every throughput figure in the design document was taken on one 8-logical /
4-physical, 14 GB machine and does not transfer.

The phases, and what each exists to defend against:
  A  thread sizing            -- more threads than the quota allows is slower
  B  position-cost curve      -- decode collapses with depth (48 -> 5 tok/s)
  B-prefill  prefill curve    -- prefill is compute-bound, NOT the decode curve
  C  joint worst case         -- per-session cost does not predict joint cost
  D  finished tables + gate   -- engine never re-derives on the hot path
  E  atomic store + fallback  -- an interrupted shutdown must not corrupt it
  F  clamps on OWN output     -- calibration succeeding but returning nonsense
  G  absolute ceiling         -- a corrupted curve must not lift the cap

ONE curve captures both memory and CPU. Every decode step attends to every
prior token; reading that token's K/V is what costs the bandwidth AND the
space. They are two costs of the same growing quantity, position -- not two
things that happen to correlate.

Keyed by the vocab handle, not a bare global: a token id is only meaningful
for the vocabulary that produced it. One process only ever calibrates one
model today (a model switch re-execs), but a bare cache would silently hand a
second model the FIRST model's filler token and corrupt its curves with no
error -- the kind of assumption that should be enforced, not remembered.

#### calibration._decode

Return codes are checked, not assumed. Section 11a records two separate
occasions where an unchecked llama_decode return produced a physically
impossible throughput number (41323 tok/s once, a negative switch cost
another time). A silent failure here would make calibration confidently
wrong, which is worse than calibration failing.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
low-level helpers -- every return code checked
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### calibration.phase_a_threads

NOT the physical core count. Measured on the reference machine: 8 threads
is SLOWER than 4 (hyperthread contention, not parallelism), and the
deployed value must additionally match the cpu.max quota -- setting one
without the other is the nonlinear-loss regime section 11 measured.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Phases
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

n_threads is a CONTEXT parameter, so the model -- the expensive part, a
full GGUF load -- is loaded once and only the context is rebuilt per
candidate. Reloading the model each time did the same work 3-4x over.

#### calibration.phase_b_position_curve

Section 11a's rule, and the reason there are two: the median is
representative and feeds the output-cap formula; the WORST observed trial
feeds anything that is a hard cutoff, because the spread is real (19% at
short context, measured, not hypothetical). Using the median for admission
means a round estimated at 45ms can genuinely take 54ms.

Piecewise interpolation between real points, deliberately -- section 11a
tried fitting the closed-form "fixed weight-read + linear KV-read" model
and it does NOT hold (the slope of 1/tps is not monotonic in position).

Truncate back to `pos` before EVERY trial. llama.cpp requires
sequence positions to stay consecutive: the previous trial left
the cache at pos+probe_tokens, so starting the next one at `pos`
again fails with "it is required that the sequence positions
remain consecutive". Cheaper than re-filling from zero.

#### calibration.phase_b_prefill_curve

Decode is memory-bandwidth-bound: one token, but every prior K/V vector is
read. Prefill is compute-bound and parallel: many tokens in one pass
amortising the same weight read. Reusing the decode curve for prefill
admission would be wrong by roughly an order of magnitude.

Worst-observed, not median -- this feeds an admission cutoff (section 9b).

#### calibration.phase_c_joint_worst_case

A REAL measurement, not an extrapolation from Phase B. Section 11a proved
extrapolation unreliable here, not merely theoretically risky: the naive
prediction was ~41 tok/s where the joint measurement gave 12.5 -- a 3x
error in the OPTIMISTIC direction. Per-session cost genuinely does not
predict joint cost, because the KV-read terms stack rather than share.

#### calibration.derive_output_cap_table

Section 12 test 31 checks exactly this: the engine reads the table and
never recomputes a cap from raw curve data on a request path.

Uses the MEDIAN column -- this is the representative estimate, not a
safety cutoff.

#### calibration.phase_f_clamp

This covers calibration SUCCEEDING and returning nonsense from an internal
bug -- n_threads=0, an absurd n_ctx, a negative tok/s. Different failure
class, different defense. Converts "trust calibration got it right" into
"trust calibration to optimise within bounds that hold even when it is
wrong", which is the property actually wanted.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Phase F -- clamps on calibration's OWN output
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### calibration.save

Section 11a traced the real shutdown path: MalabrManager::StopMLServer
calls Terminate(0, false) -- SIGTERM, with wait=false, so the browser does
NOT confirm our handler finished. If the OS force-kills during a fast
logout mid-write, a plain write leaves a truncated file. This is the only
thing the design persists at all, so it is exactly the operation that race
can catch.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Phase E -- atomic store, and a fallback that treats corrupt as missing
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### calibration.load

"Unparseable" is treated exactly like "missing" -- not as an error. A
truncated file from an interrupted shutdown must fall back to fresh
calibration, not crash the server on startup.

#### calibration.conservative_fallback

Deliberately pessimistic rather than a guess at typical hardware. Being
too conservative costs throughput; being optimistic breaks the latency
bound the whole scheduler exists to hold.

Same SHAPE as a measured result, deliberately. A fallback that omits
keys makes every consumer crash on the one path where things are
already going wrong.

#### calibration.run

Never raises: a calibration failure falls back (Phase E) rather than
stopping the server. Section 11c's audit is explicit that isolation and
browser-protection do NOT depend on calibration -- only conversation
length and speed do -- so a fallback degrades quality, not safety.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Orchestration
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### calibration.apply_to_engine

The engine holds these from startup and never re-derives them per round
(section 12 test 31).

#### calibration._interpolate

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Phase D -- finished tables and the validation gate
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

### config

#### config.(module)

Sizing is COMPUTED AT STARTUP from detected hardware, not hardcoded. The
inherited config hardcoded n_ctx=4096, which at n_seq_max=8 gives 512 tokens
per session -- roughly 6-8 short chat turns before compaction fires on EVERY
conversation. That tests "does compaction work at all" rather than "does the
policy correctly decide whose context to shrink under contention", which is
the actual research question.

Fraction of USABLE RAM the KV pool may claim. The pool is a STOCK, not a
flow: n_ctx is allocated once as a single fixed block at context creation and
there is no runtime path by which it can grow. RSS was measured flat (~1139MB)
whether 1 or 8 sessions were resident, which is why no cgroup memory ceiling
is needed on top -- the allocation already cannot exceed itself.

SECTION 11 SAYS 0.8 OF MemAvailable. That is measurably wrong here and the
number is not a rounding difference: on this machine it yields 75,340 tokens
= 7.7 GB of KV, against the 16,384 (1.7 GB) section 7 states outright -- 4.6x
apart. Three reasons the formula overshoots:
  1. MemAvailable counts reclaimable page cache as free. True for transient
     allocations, false for a PERMANENT reservation. Here MemAvailable is
     ~9 GB of which almost all is cache, and swap is already full.
  2. It never subtracts the model weights, which are also resident.
  3. It leaves nothing for the browser -- and protecting the browser from the
     inference engine is the entire point of the design.
So: a smaller fraction, an explicit browser reserve, and the model subtracted.

Floor and ceiling on the computed context size. The floor keeps a small
machine from computing a context so tight that compaction is permanent; the
ceiling stops a large machine from reserving absurd amounts of RAM for a
feature the user may never use.

Section 7 states n_ctx = 16384 outright. Used as the default ceiling so the
computed value agrees with the document on reference hardware instead of
exceeding it by 4x; raise it deliberately via MALABR_N_CTX on a machine with
real headroom.

#### config.compute_n_threads

Setting one without the other is the nonlinear-loss regime measured in
section 11: squeezing more threads than the quota allows forces the kernel
to preempt and context-switch them inside a shrunk slice -- pure overhead,
no extra work done.

#### config.compute_cpu_max_cores

So: half the logical CPUs, but never below n_threads + 1 so it cannot
throttle a normal decode. MALABR_CPU_MAX overrides ("N" cores, "N%", or
"0"/"off" to disable).

NOTE the two percent conventions in this module are different on purpose:
  MALABR_CPU_MAX=N%  -> N percent of ONE core (cpulimit's convention;
                        "150%" = 1.5 cores, machine-size-independent)
  QUOTA_PCT / MALABR_QUOTA_PCT -> percent of ALL physical cores

#### config.list_models

The chat panel's model switcher offers exactly this set; a switch names one
of these and the server re-execs with MALABR_MODEL_PATH pointed at it.

#### config.resolve_model

Returns None if the name is not one of the directory's .gguf files -- the
switcher must never be able to make the server exec an arbitrary path.

#### config.ServerConfig.n_ctx_per_session

Shared-KV: a SOFT cap (n_ctx/2 by default) -- the aggregate cap does the
real bounding. Partitioned: the HARD slice llama.cpp enforces.

#### config.ServerConfig

Shared-KV mode (MALABR_SHARED_KV=1). Off: the KV cache is pre-partitioned
into n_seq_max equal hard slices and a session cannot exceed n_ctx/n_seq_max
(llama.cpp enforces this). On: kv_unified=true, one shared pool of n_ctx
cells, each session gets a LARGER soft cap (n_ctx // shared_kv_soft_div,
default n_ctx/2) and compaction is driven by AGGREGATE pressure -- so 1-2
tabs get a big budget and many tabs degrade to roughly fair share.

Cooperative CPU throttle (MALABR_CPU_DUTY, 0<d<=1). The engine sleeps
proportionally after each round, so average CPU lands near n_threads * d
-- smoothly, and with no cgroup / launch-path plumbing. 1.0 = flat out.

HARD CPU ceiling in cores (MALABR_CPU_MAX). 0 = disabled. Default computed
by compute_cpu_max_cores() -- half the logical CPUs, never below
n_threads+1, so it is a runaway backstop, not a normal-operation limit.

#### config.load_config

root is the mserver/ package dir; models live one level up beside it, in
addition_malabr/models. Deriving model_dir from `root` put it in
mserver/models, where nothing is -- calibration fell straight through to
its Phase E fallback and reported a conservative curve as if measured.

An explicit value may exceed MAX_N_CTX on purpose (see the constant),
but it is still rounded down to a multiple of n_seq_max -- and a typo
below n_seq_max would round to 0 and fail deep inside llama.cpp with
nothing pointing back here. Floor it at one whole slot per sequence.

Section 4's ONE stated exception to "nothing durable": calibration
data is written to disk on purpose, so a cold start does not have to
re-measure the machine every time.

### protocol

#### protocol.(module)

Section 10a is the contract and the C++ side is already written to it; where
Python disagrees, Python is wrong. Every format here was checked against the
built C++ (mserver_uds.cc), not only against the prose.

Two connection kinds share one header format:
  request  ROUTE_MALABR_GENERATE_API, then payload_size bytes of prompt
  control  ROUTE_MALABR_CONTROL, payload_size=0, then push messages forever

A user-initiated stop. Its own route rather than a fifth control message,
because extensions/browser cannot include chrome/browser/malabr_manager.h
(Chromium layering) and so cannot reach the control connection at all. The
request header already carries the full session identity, so a stop needs
nothing the generate path does not already send.

Matches kMaxFramePayload in mserver_uds.cc. The bound exists because the
length is read straight off the wire: without it, a co-resident process with
direct socket access (threat actor 4) can name any size and make us allocate
it. Section 10 records this same bug on the C++ side; this is the mirror of
it, in the other direction.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Control connection -- section 10a's four message types
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### protocol.recv_full

Callers MUST bound `size` before calling -- see MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE. This
function deliberately does not enforce a policy bound of its own, because
it is also used for small fixed-size reads; the bound belongs where the
size is parsed off the wire.

#### protocol.ClientEnvelope

    route,extension_id,tab_id,origin,visibility,payload_size

Everything except payload_size is browser-derived and unspoofable by the
page -- that is the whole basis of section 5's identity model. It is still
validated here, because the socket is reachable by any co-resident process.

#### protocol.unpack_client_envelope

The previous version split into 3 fields and raised otherwise, which
rejected every generate() and every control connection once the browser
started sending 6.

Every field is ASCII by construction: route and visibility are
literals, extension_id is a-p, tab_id is digits, and a serialized
origin is ASCII. Non-ASCII means the peer is not our C++.

Section 5g / malabr_api.cc:77. EVERY opaque origin serializes to the
literal "null" (RFC 6454), so two unrelated opaque-origin documents
would produce the SAME session key and share a session -- exactly the
cross-origin leak the origin field exists to close. The C++ already
refuses these; this is the second gate, because the peer may not be
our C++.

BOUND BEFORE recv_full -- the whole point. The inherited code checked only
for < 0, so a peer could claim any size and the server would try to
receive and buffer it.

#### protocol.read_frame

Only used by the test harness -- the browser is the real reader.

#### protocol.parse_control_message

LIVE_TABS is STATE, not an event, and that distinction is the whole reason
it exists: a TAB_CLOSED lost while the control connection was down can never
be replayed, because once the tab is gone the browser has no record it ever
existed. Pushing the full live set on every (re)connect lets the server
reconcile instead of relying on having seen every event.

"LIVE_TABS" with no ids is legitimate and means NO live tabs, which
must reap everything. Treating it as malformed would leave every
session alive at exactly the moment they should all be freed.

#### protocol.ClientEnvelope.session_key

Without it, navigating one tab from a bank site to another site let the
new site's content script inherit a session still holding the bank
conversation.

#### protocol.ClientEnvelope.is_foreground_seed

It is ignored for an existing session, because the control connection's
FOREGROUND message is authoritative and ordering between the two is not
guaranteed. A stale seed must never override live state.

### app

#### app.(module)

Launched by MalabrManager as `python3 addition_malabr/mserver/app.py`
(chrome/browser/malabr_manager.cc:36).

Startup order matters and is not arbitrary:
  1. config       -- sizing computed from THIS machine, not baked in
  2. pid lock     -- acquired for real, first, so a duplicate start exits in
                     milliseconds instead of after a full model load
  3. CPU ceiling  -- after the lock, so a rejected start never creates a
                     systemd scope it will not use; before anything heavy
  4. model+ctx    -- one context, created once, owned by the engine thread
  5. calibration  -- measured or loaded from disk; feeds the scheduler
  6. engine       -- started before the socket exists, so the first request
                     never races an engine that is not running yet
  7. socket       -- last, because accepting a connection we cannot serve is
                     worse than making the browser retry its connect

#### app.apply_cpu_ceiling

A pure backstop -- the default (config.compute_cpu_max_cores) is half the
logical CPUs and always above n_threads, so it never bites normal
operation. It exists only so a bug or a pathological model cannot take the
whole machine; MALABR_CPU_DUTY is the smooth throttle that sets where usage
actually sits.

Why a self-move via busctl and not `systemd-run --scope python app.py`: that
leaves systemd-run as the parent and python as a child IN the scope, and
MalabrManager's Terminate(pid) on the parent does NOT propagate to python
(tested). Moving our OWN pid into the scope keeps the pid MalabrManager
tracks, has no intermediary to leak, and the empty scope is GC'd when we
exit. cpu is not delegated to our starting scope, so writing cpu.max
directly is impossible; systemd (the cgroup manager) enables the controller
when a CPU property is set on the new scope.

Best-effort: any failure (no busctl, not under a user systemd, denied) logs
and continues unthrottled -- the duty throttle still applies.

Inside the try: this function's contract is "any failure logs and
continues unthrottled", and an unreadable /proc (a hardened or
procfs-less environment) must not be the one exception that crashes
startup instead.

busctl returned 0 but there is no cpu.max quota on our cgroup.
systemd does this silently when the cpu controller is not
delegated to the user session -- the scope exists, the ceiling
does not. Say so rather than log a false success.

#### app._cpu_max_quota_active

A zero return code from busctl is not proof the quota exists: systemd will
create the scope and drop the CPU property without error when the cpu
controller is not delegated to the user session. The move into the new
scope can lag the call slightly, so retry briefly.

#### app.build

An EXPLICIT MALABR_N_THREADS must win over the cached calibration's pick --
otherwise the env var is silently a no-op whenever calibration.json exists,
which is almost always.

One shared pool of n_ctx cells instead of n_seq_max hard slices, so a
session can grow past n_ctx/n_seq_max. The engine's aggregate guard is
then what keeps the total within n_ctx.

#### app.main

Take the single-instance lock FOR REAL, first thing. This is spawned
by MalabrManager, so a duplicate start (a browser restart that did
not confirm the old child died) is expected, and exit 3 keeps it out
of the Chrome log as a crash. It must be a real acquire, not a
read-only probe: a probe leaves the pidfile unclaimed through the
~2-minute cold build(), so two launches close together both pass it
and both pay for a model load and calibration before one is turned
away at the socket. And it must precede apply_cpu_ceiling, or the
rejected start still spins up a systemd scope it will never use.
